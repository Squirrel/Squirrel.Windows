# Squirrel.Windows

_It's a installer and updating framework for desktop applications on Windows_

No installer UI, no UAC, just double click and launch.

Based on [NuGet](http://docs.nuget.org/), Squirrel takes care of building your release files, creating your setup and provides an API to check for updates and get them installed.
