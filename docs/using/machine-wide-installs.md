# Machine-wide Installs

Squirrel's Releasify command generates an MSI file suitable for installation via Group Policy. This MSI isn't a general-purpose installer, this means that once you run the MSI, users from now on will get the app installed, on next Login.

So, most normal users should continue to run the Setup.exe's generated by Releasify, but if you want to have an IT Admin Friendly version, you can hand off the MSI

Most users of Squirrel won't have to do anything new to enable this behavior, though certain NuGet package IDs / names might cause problems with MSI. 

**Source:** See [issue #466](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/issues/466) for more details.

### Disabling MSI Generation
Generating MSIs can be disabled via the --no-msi flag as shown below:

~~~powershell
PM> Squirrel --releasify MyApp.1.0.0.nupkg --no-msi
